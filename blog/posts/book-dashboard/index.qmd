Building a dashboard using quarto and gt package for the table

## MyBook Dashboard

Hello, for this time i built dashboard to track the books that i have read. To see the dashboard you can visit <https://nusaseldi.github.io/mybook_dashboard>.

In the dashboard, you can see how many books that i already read and the details about the book from title, author, genre, and pages. I also included the the rating that i got from [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). I hope I can read books consistently every month!
